# ⚡ AEMR Outage Analysis – SQL & Tableau  

## 📖 Description  
This project analyzes outage data for the **American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR)** to uncover key insights into energy loss patterns, facility performance, and outage causes.  

Using **SQL**, I performed data cleaning, aggregation, ranking, and percentage contribution analysis to identify high-impact outages. The results were further visualized in **Tableau** with interactive dashboards that highlight:  
- Energy loss trends  
- Facility and participant performance  
- Outage categories (Forced vs Routine)  

This project showcases strong skills in **SQL querying, analytical reasoning, and data visualization** to translate raw data into actionable business insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used  
- **SQL** → Joins, Aggregations, Window Functions, Ranking  
- **Tableau** → Interactive dashboards for outage trends & facility performance  
- **Data Storytelling** → Translating technical results into business insights  

---

## 📊 Results  
- Identified **top facilities with the highest forced outage energy loss**, e.g., GW facility losing ~28,687 MW due to operational issues.  
- Calculated **percentage contribution of each outage** to overall forced outage energy loss.  
- Ranked outages per participant, uncovering the most critical reliability risks.  
- Built **Tableau dashboards** that reveal:  
  - Facility-wise total energy loss  
  - Outage reasons distribution (Forced vs Routine)  
  - Participant comparison of energy reliability  

These insights can help **regulators and energy companies** prioritize reliability improvements and risk mitigation.
